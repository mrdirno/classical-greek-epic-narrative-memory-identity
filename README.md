## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Nikias discovers a physical object (a tablet, a buried chest, a marked stone) that contradicts the official story of his departure.
- Create a scene from the perspective of Phileas, the helmsman, reflecting on the man Nikias was when they first sailed versus the man returning to Iolkos.
- Draft a monologue by Uncle Cycnus, explaining his true motivations for declaring Nikias dead and his fear of the past Nikias represents.
- Write an 'interlude' chapter set during Nikias's years at sea, showing a key moment that forged his identity, which is now unknown to those on land.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'Memory Map' for the novel, where readers can trace the geography of Nikias's physical journey against the timeline of his key memories and the conflicting stories told about him in Iolkos.
- Develop a text analysis tool that compares the language and imagery used in Nikias's 'sea memories' (dynamic, sensory) versus his 'land memories' (static, fragmented) to visualize his dual identity.
